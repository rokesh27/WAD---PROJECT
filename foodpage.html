            <p class="hp">We aim to redistribute surplus food to those who are in need of it. If you have excess food from an event, party, wedding etc, please call our helpline, our volunteers will collect the excess food from you and distribute it among people who need it.  The excess food will be checked for quality because lack of proper refrigeration and storage tend to spoil food.</p>
