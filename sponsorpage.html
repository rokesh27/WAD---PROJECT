                <p>At the Good Shepherd Agricultural Mission, we’d like to create a more personal experience for both our children and their sponsors. We believe connection is what our kids need most, more than money, more than gifts. They need to know that someone cares.

                    Our children come from a multitude of backgrounds, some with at least one parent or other family member, some with no one outside the Mission gates. Those with surviving relatives often maintain some level of contact with their families. These bonds are encouraged by us, as we know how important a sense of family is to a child’s development. And so we’re looking for people who care. Supportive, champions to encourage and connect with our kids. These are the kinds of people we intend to involve in our child sponsorship program.
                    
                    It doesn’t cost much to support a child in India. Just $1 a day is all we need. This may not seem like much money to you, but as you read on hopefully you will be able to understand ‘why’ and ‘how’ we can do so much for so little.

                Like any parent, we want to be careful with what we give to our children. While we want them to feel loved by you, and gift giving is a great way to do that, we also need to be sensitive to the fact that not all of our children have sponsors that can lavish them with gifts. For this reason, we suggest that the best gifts you can give to your sponsored child are things that don’t cost much of anything; letters, photos, Skype calls and the like. When presents are called for, such as for birthdays, make sure to be in contact with our Child Sponsorship Supervisor before purchasing anything. Please note that mobile phones and laptops are absolutely not acceptable as gifts for our children under any circumstances
