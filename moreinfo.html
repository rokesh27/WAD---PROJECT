            <h2>What is food redistribution? </h2>
            <p>
                Redistribution is the process whereby
            surplus food that would otherwise have
            ended up as waste is, instead, made
            available for people to eat
            About 6.7 million tonnes of food is wasted every year by the households. It is about one third of the 21.7 million tonnes food purchased by the households
            </p>

            <h2>The issue with food waste</h2>
            <p>Food waste is an issue that affects
                everyone in the food supply chain
                including cafés, restaurants and hotels,
                as well as wholesale, manufacturing and
                retail food organisations. The amount
                of food a business throws away is one
                indicator of the efficiency of the business. </p>
                </div>
                <div class=c23>
            <h2>Why redistribute surplus food</h2>
           <p>Food redistribution can offer many
            environmental, social and economic
            benefits, including:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> Saving on your waste disposal costs.</li>
            <li> Providing food directly to people
             in need.</li>
            <li>Impacting positively on staff morale.</li>
        <li> Enhancing your reputation with your</li>
             customers.<br>
            <li>Helping achieve your business’s</li>
             environmental targets.<br>
            </ul>

                What can you redistribute?
            </h2>
            
            <li> <b>Raw materials</b> – any food that has been
                purchased, not used, but is still fit for
                human consumption.</li>
            <li><b>Durability dates</b> – any food products nearing
                their best-before and use-by dates.</li>
            <li> <b>Packaged food</b> – non-perishable food
                products in unopened packaging (e.g.
                condiments, biscuits and fruit juices).</li>
            <li> <b>Meals</b> – if these have not been served, then
                they can be redistributed. However, it is recommended that meals should not be
                donated if they contain raw fish or eggs, or
                have been cooked at lower temperatures
                unless appropriate time/temperature
                conditions have been met.</li>
            <li> <b>Manufacturing processes</b> – products can be
                redistributed if they have not been in direct
                contact with customers
                Once you have identified where food surplus
                might occur, you should assess the likely
                quantity and how often it happens.</li>
