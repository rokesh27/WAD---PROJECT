    <div class="column1">
        <p>In times of crisis, children in poverty are especially vulnerable and face<br> uncertain futures. Your monthly gift of Rs5000 will give your sponsored<br> child access to life-changing benefits, like medical care, educational<br> support, life skills and job training before graduation.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>As a sponsor, you'll be able to see your impact firsthand through letters<br> and photos from your child. You’ll see how much you’re helping a child<br> when they need it most.</p>

<h1>What is child sponsorship?</h1>
<p>Child sponsorship connects two people — a sponsor with a <br>generous heart and a child living in poverty.</p><br><br>
<p>From toddlerhood to young adulthood, our child sponsorship<br> program equips kids with crucial life and job skills to break the<br> cycle of poverty. For good.</p><br><br>
<h3>Your Rs5000 monthly gift supports</h3>
<p>1. A safe place<br>
    2. A caring team of local staff and volunteers<br>
    3. A path out of poverty through life-changing programs and services<br></p>
