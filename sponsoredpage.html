                            <p>Children in poverty are more likely to be exposed to the stress of violence, gangs and drugs. This can negatively affect brain development and long-term well-being. Your support during this vulnerable time helps children and youth set their own goals to build a life free from poverty.</p>

                                    When you sponsor a child, you create a powerful multiplier effect. You help them see beyond the daily struggles of life in poverty. Your support releases them from a cycle of short-term decisions and helps them gain the ability to begin contributing to their own families and communities.
